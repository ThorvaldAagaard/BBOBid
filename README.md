# BBOBid

BBOBid is an extension, that during bidding on BBO can show the bids defined in your own system, if you have documented your systemat http://bidding.aalborgdata.com/

The implementation is heavily inspired by BBOAlert by Stanislaw Mazur, and if you have documented your system using BBOAlert you will be able to import that into the website.

The extension is aimed at the practice tables.
